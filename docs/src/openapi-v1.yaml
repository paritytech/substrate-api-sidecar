        from Asset Hub for staking progress, this endpoint requires multi chain connections

        and add the relay chain to the SAS_SUBSTRATE_MULTI_CHAIN_URL env var. Refer to the README for the structure
        of the env vars. The `rcAt` parameter allows querying Asset Hub state using relay chain
        block numbers, enabling post-migration infrastructure to continue using relay chain
        block identifiers while accessing Asset Hub data.

        [Experimental - subject to breaking change.] Get the operations from the

      description: |
        Returns the operations from the most recently finalized block. Operations
        represent one side of a balance change. For example if Alice transfers
        100unit to Bob there will be two operations; 1) Alice - 100 2) Bob + 100.

        Given account A and A's balance at block k0 (Ak0), if we sum all the
        operations for A from block k1 through kn against Ak0, we will end up
        with A's balance at block kn (Akn). Thus, operations can be used to audit
        that balances change as expected.

        This is useful for Substrate based chains because the advanced business
        logic can make it difficult to ensure auditable balance reconciliation
        based purely on events. Instead of using events one can use the
        operations given from this endpoint.

        Note - each operation corresponds to a delta of a single field of the
        `system::AccountData` storage item (i.e `free`, `reserved`, `misc_frozen`
        and `fee_frozen`).
        Note - operations are assigned a block execution phase (and extrinsic index
        for those in the apply extrinsic phase) based on an "action group". For
        example all the operations for 1 extrinsic will be in the same action group.
        The action groups can optionally be fetched with the `action` query param
        for closer auditing.
        Note - There are no 0 value operations (e.g. a transfer of 0, or a
        transfer to itself)
